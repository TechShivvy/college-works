Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
Life is real! Life is earnest!
Dust thou art, to dust returnest,
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
But to act, that each to-morrow
Art is long, and time is fleeting,
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
In the world's broad field of battle,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!
Act,act in te living Present!
Lives of great men all remind us
and, departing, leave behin us
Footprints, that perhaps another,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Let us, then, be up and doing,
Still achieving, still pursuing,
