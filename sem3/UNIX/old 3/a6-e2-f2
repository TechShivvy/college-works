	Psalm of Life
	Life is but an empty dream!
	And things are not what they seem.
	And the grave is not its goal;
	Was not spoken of the soul.
	Is our destined end or way;
	Find us farther than to-day.
	And our hearts, though stout and brave,
	Funeral marches to the grave.
	In the bivouac of Life,
	Be ahero in the strife!
	Let the dead Past bury its dead!
	Heart within, and God o'erhead!
	We can make our lives sublime,
	Footprints on the sands of time;
	Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
	Seeing, shall take heart again.
	with a heart for any fate;
	Learn to labor and to wait.
